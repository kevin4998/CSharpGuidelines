Only use `var` as the result of a LINQ query, or if the type is very obvious from the same statement and using it would improve readability. So don't

	var item = 3;                              // what type? int? uint? float?
	var myfoo = MyFactoryMethod.Create("arg"); // Not obvious what base-class or			
	                                           // interface to expect. Also
	                                           // difficult to refactor if you can't
	                                           // search for the class

Instead, use `var` like this:

	var query = from order in orders where order.Items > 10 and order.TotalValue > 1000;
	var repository = new RepositoryFactory.Get();	
	var list = new ReadOnlyCollection();

In all of three above examples it is clear what type to expect. For a more detailed rationale about the advantages and disadvantages of using `var`, read Eric Lippert's [Uses and misuses of implicit typing](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2011/04/20/uses-and-misuses-of-implicit-typing.aspx).
