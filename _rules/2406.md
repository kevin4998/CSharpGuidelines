title: Place members in a well-defined order
severity: 1
---
Maintaining a common order allows other team members to find their way in your code more easily. In general, a source file should be readable from top to bottom, as if reading a book, to prevent readers from having to browse up and down through the code file.

1. Public constants
2. Public static read-only fields
3. Private fields and constants
4. Public properties
5. Constructors
6. Factory methods and the finalizer
7. Other methods and private properties in calling order
8. Events 

Declare local functions at the bottom of their containing method bodies (after all executable code).
