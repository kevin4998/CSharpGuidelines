title: Identify `#region` levels with `-`-symbols and use sparsly
severity: 1

Regions require extra work without increasing the quality or the readability of code. Instead they make code harder to view and refactor.

If regions are used, ensure that the top-level regions use 3 dashes to highlight the name. Every child-region should use one less dash than its parent until there are none-left. Example

`#region --- Properties ---`

`#region -- Zoom Properties --`

`#endregion`

`#region -- Target Properties --`

`#endregion`

`#endregion`
